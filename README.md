IT Help Desk Request Analysis
=====

##The Problem

Like many IT departments, the City of Asheville uses a Help Desk system to track and manage the many requests for service that come in every day. Requests cover a wide range of issues including password reset requests, new hardware requests, notifications of inoperable tools or websites, software bugs, training requests, and much more. In all, technicians and analysts respond to thousands of requests for service each year. We know the importance of working smarter and identifying opportunities for automation. To that end, we would like to analyze the history of Help Desk requests, idenitfy patterns, and see if we can learn a thing or two that will help us work better and smarter. Think about the analysis as well as relevant visualizations to communicate your findings.

Please note that this problem and associated data are real. The long range goal of this task is to help us identify low-value, repetitive work that can be automated so that we can focus our energy on higher-value work. 

##Data 

* Help Desk request data is stored in a .csv file and can be found here along with descriptive metadata: https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0B-uuat4PtUk1ZlpZcFhlM2lXSnc&usp=sharing  

##Rules

Keep it simple. We are not looking for a finished product, but instead think "minimal"... something that could start us down the path of awesome.  This is your chance to show us what you can do!

* You may use any resources or tools that you like.
* Feel free to reuse/borrow code (like you would in the real world!)
* However, the actual work should be done by you.
* You can ask us questions - we prefer you use this repo's issues. (Email is also fine)

##Submissions

We really prefer to get submissions via GitHub. If you deliver visualizations, consider using Github pages. But if you have other ways of working, that's fine. Just be sure the your work is freely available and accessible on the web.

**Please complete your submission by Friday, October 16th, at 9am.** Early submissions are welcome!
